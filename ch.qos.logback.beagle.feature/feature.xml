      During the development process, it is common for developers to
print log output on the console. Typically, the developer will
also customize the format of the log output by setting properties
of a PatternLayout instance. Logback Beagle serves the same purpose
as the regular console, but offers several advantages over the
plain-old console. 
Here is a list of key advantages of our plugin:
- coloring of events
- easy jump to caller 
- flexible output format
- easy configuration
